        <p>I am Annie and I am a student at Cerritos College.  I am a product designer focused in softgoods.  I am taking this class to expand my knowledge on things we use daily so I feel I am somewhat up to date with the latest technology that designates our daily life.  Aside from that, I also like to do the following activities. </p>
        <ul>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Play with my dog</li>
    <li>Watch TV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My favorite website for beginners to learn HTML is <a href ="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a></p>
